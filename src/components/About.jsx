            he went after graduation. From that time onwards, he became

              Sunny’s was started in September of 1995 by Arjun Sajnani and
              Vivek Ubhayakar, both of whom had recently returned from New York.
              From its very inception the restaurant had a certain je ne sais
              quoi factor that quickly propelled it to a singular category
              within the culinary scene in Bangalore. Offering a small menu of
              Italian and French cuisine, Sunny’s has always relied on the
              authenticity of its food and the purity and freshness of its
              produce to present a culinary vision that has remained intact to
              this day. In the growth process the menu has expanded and
              diversified to make it a truly international restaurant.

              Given the popularity of the salads at Sunny’s it was always in the
              cards to eventually market the dressings and sauces which have
              stood the test of time through all these years. While the pandemic
              was disastrous for the restaurant and hospitality business, it did
              afford an opportunity for startup enterprises that had a
              marketable product. The contemporary householder needs quality
              products to add to their meals in order to satisfy the gourmet
              enthusiast in them, as well as provide wholesome, healthy meals.
              It was obvious from the very beginning that these quality products
              could become an essential part of any kitchen’s pantry.

                As a restaurateur and a chef, Arjun personally handled the menu
                at Sunny’s to ensure that quality and taste are its hallmarks.
                In the field of the Arts, Arjun has continued to work on
                prominent works by many playwrights, international and Indian,
                particularly the works of Girish Karnad with whom he shares the
                love for food and theater. Girish’s play Agni Mattu Mallai was
                made into a film Agni Varsha, by Arjun.
